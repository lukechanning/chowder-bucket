> My name is Luke Patrick, and a long time ago, I was born — like most people. I've been pretty busy since. Router Chowder is my blog: I use it to share my experiences and code with those that need them.

I used to work as a writer, covering everything from turkey recipes to big tech news. But I broke my hands and had to learn graphic design. A little after that, I helped start Kangabloo Creative in Central Arkansas. After three years as Creative Director, I'm back in Boulder, Colorado with a suitcase full of marketing, design and web development experience.

I am currently freelancing, consulting, and / or feeding two cats — the fluffy wangs.

##Projects I am involved with 

*   [Kangabloo Creative](http://kangabloo.com) - A small business marketing agency based in Conway, AR
*   [Snod & Jeff](http://kangabloo.com) - A marketing agency for outdoor products and craft brewers in Boulder, CO
