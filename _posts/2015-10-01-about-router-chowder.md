> #### Hi!<br> We're Router Chowder, a micro-agency and blog.

</div>

<div class="small-7 columns" markdown='1'>

We are a three person agency, and we make _awesome_ stuff for the Web. Whether it's [WordPress tools](/tag/tools/) or web apps, we to love code. We also write about web development, music and [Boulder](https://bouldercolorado.gov/). Add in the fact that we can (kinda) dance, and we're a triple threat! You _know_ our moms are proud.

<p>Nic is some kind of wizard â€” it's the only way to explain the <em>incredible</em> code she makes. Nic sneezes on New York subways regularly. Hopefully, this changes in the future. </p>
