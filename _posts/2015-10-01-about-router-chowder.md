> My name is Luke Patrick, and I'm that dude up there. A long time ago, I was born â€” like most people. I've been pretty busy since.

I used to work as a writer, covering everything from turkey recipes to big tech news. Then I helped create [Kangabloo Creative](http://kangabloo.com) in Central Arkansas. After three years as Creative Director, I'm back in Boulder with a suitcase full of marketing, design and web development experience.

> **Router Chowder** is a blog covering fun stuff like web design, music and life in Boulder, CO. 

It is also a company made up of real people with magical abilities. We make incredible stuff, all of which you can buy to help continue the awesome-sauce you see here. For more information, see the header above. It's the big green thing. You can't miss it.
