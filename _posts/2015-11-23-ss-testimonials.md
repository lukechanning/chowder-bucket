Over the years, we’ve used a lot of WordPress testimonial plugins. Some were bells-and-whistles types, others were barebones fixer-uppers. But we never could find an option that was simple, easy to setup, and looked damn good doing it.

**So, we made our own freaking plugin!**

S.S. Testimonials — or _stupid simple_ — is a lightweight, minimalistic approach to WordPress testimonials. It takes only three minutes to install and display, from activation to final touches. Likewise, it requires no additional editing or code knowledge to look _exactly_ like the box. We call it “no assembly required.”

Best of all, you can charge this bad boy anywhere text is accepted. Just add the `[ss-testimonials]` shortcode where you want testimonials to magically appear. The rest is taken care of. Don’t even sweat it!

A short list of features includes: 

1. 6 unique themes to get the ball rolling in your theme.
2. Easy customization via the built-in WordPress Customizer — if you can click, you can change the settings.
3. 3 minutes from installation to display. 
4. We aren't kidding. It'll look exactly like the tin in freaky fast time. 
5. Built-in custom stylesheet for easy developer access.
6. All the latest and greatest frameworks under the hood, ensuring maximum browser compatibility. Does Grandma use Internet Explorer? Not a problem.

We’re proud of the results, and we think it’s the perfect option for end users and hardcore coders alike. S.S. Testimonials includes a built-in, customizable CSS sheet for the salty tech savvy folks.

Our testimonials plugin is also built on the best standards and includes rock-solid jQuery via [Owl Carousel 2](http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/) and the best in responsive CSS thanks to [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io). At barely over 100kb installed, it’s also crazy thin.

To see just how stupid simple the whole testimonials thing can be, we dare you to give it a try.
