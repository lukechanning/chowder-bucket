Over the years, we’ve used a lot of WordPress testimonial plugins. Some were bells-and-whistles types, others were barebones fixer-uppers. But we never could find an option that was simple, easy to setup, and looked damn good doing it.

**So, we made our own freaking plugin!**

Stupid Simple Testimonials is a lightweight, minimalistic approach to WordPress testimonials. It takes only three minutes to install and display, from activation to final touches. Likewise, it requires no additional editing or code knowledge to look _exactly_ like the box. We call it “no assembly required.”

Best of all, you can charge this bad boy anywhere text is accepted. Just add the `[simple-testimonials]` shortcode where you want testimonials to magically appear. The rest is taken care of. Don’t even sweat it!

A short list of features includes: 

1.  Multiple page layouts, including a **touch-enabled slider** and a dynamic grid
2.  **Grid layout automatically adjusts** to match total number of testimonials, creating an attractive design every time
3.  **Six unique color schemes** to match any theme you’ve got
4.  Divide your testimonials into **categories** for easy management
5.  Stupid simple shortcode – **[simple-testimonials]** – that can be used in pages, posts and widgets
6.  Beautiful, minimalist design that **works right out of the box**, no coding required
7.  Installation and setup so simple you can have it running in **3 minutes or less**
8.  Easy testimonial editing using the standard WordPress editor – no need to learn new, complicated layouts
9.  Fully **compatible with Visual Composer**, so you can use the tools you know and love
10.  Beautiful documentation and full support. It works out-of-the-box, but we’re here just in case.

We’re proud of the results, and we think it’s the perfect option for end users and hardcore coders alike. Stupid Simple Testimonials includes a built-in, customizable CSS sheet for the salty tech savvy folks.

Our testimonials plugin is also built on the best standards and includes rock-solid jQuery via [Owl Carousel 2](http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/) and the best in responsive CSS thanks to [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io). At barely over 100kb installed, it’s also crazy thin.

To see just how stupid simple the whole testimonials thing can be, we dare you to give it a try.
