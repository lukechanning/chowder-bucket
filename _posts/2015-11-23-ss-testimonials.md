Over the years, we’ve used a lot of WordPress testimonial plugins. Some were bells-and-whistles types, others were barebones fixer-uppers. But we never could find an option that was simple, easy to setup, and looked damn good doing it. 

**So, we made our own freaking plugin!**

S.S. Testimonials — or _stupid simple_ — is a lightweight, minimalistic approach to WordPress testimonials. It takes only three minutes to install and display, from activation to final touches. Likewise, it requires no additional editing or code knowledge to look _exactly _like the box. We call it “no assembly required.” 

Best of all, you can charge this bad boy anywhere text is accepted. Just add the `[ss-testimonials]` shortcode where you want testimonials to magically appear. The rest is taken care of. Don’t even sweat it!

We’re proud of the results, and we think it’s the perfect option for end users and hardcore coders alike. S.S. Testimonials includes a built-in, customizable CSS sheet for the salty tech savvy folks. Plus, there’s four shortcode options for those that like to dabble — but keep their hands clean.

Our testimonials plugin is also built on the latest standards and includes rock-solid jQuery via [Owl Carousel 2](http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/). At under 100kb installed, it’s also crazy thin. 

To see just how stupid simple the whole testimonials thing can be, we dare you to give it a try.
