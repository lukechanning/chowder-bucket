Chowder Bucket
====

The base theme used for my personal blog, [RouterChowder](http://routerchowder.com).

It is loosely built off the fantatic [Flex](https://github.com/the-development/flex) theme.

All the code contained here endeavours to be as explanatory as possible. If you'd like to build off of what's here, feel free to fork and explore! All I ask is that you give a nod (or donate) where your heart desires. 

Installation
===
To use this theme, you would do so like any other Jekyll setup:

1. Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
2. Fork this repository to your machine
3. `cd` to the forked directory and run `jekyll serve --watch`
4. Boogie on from there, Reggae Woman!

Contributions
===

For the most part, contributions will not be accepted. That being said, you are _more than_ welcome to pop the hood, fork the project, and create your own version of the theme! If you do modify the base code, be sure to let me know on Twitter: [lukepatrick](http://twitter.com/lukechanning)
